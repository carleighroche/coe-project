# INFO 4260 Soundscape Visualization
This visualization is part of a larger project used to visualize and interact with sound and space within the environment as an examination of the impact of Bitcoin mining operations and how they affect the landscape around them. This project has been inspired by the work of Cornell CISâ€™s Owen Marshall, Marina Zafiris, Chris Csikszentmihalyi, and others to investigate the impact of the Bitcoin facility on its host environment - Greenidge, on Seneca lake - and the local community and ecosystems that interact with it. 

# Data
The Bitcoin historical dataset used to create a general mapping of trading activity and mining operations was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/btcinusd?resource=download), with credit to Prasoon Kottarathil.
